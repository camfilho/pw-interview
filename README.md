## Introduction

Thanks for taking the time to complete this exercise.

We're very excited that you're considering joining our amazing team!

## Application

The goal of the application in this repository is to provide you a very basic Rails API so you don't need to run `rails new new_app` and scaffold a new backend app. We didn't include a test suite, because the idea is to let developers choose which tools they prefer to use.

## Goals

We don't want to see a complete solution for this challenge. We want to observe your style while you're solving a problem.

This is an opportunity for you to shine and show us how quality-driven you are.

Things we look out for in your solution:

- great communication
- a working solution that meets the requirements
- your ability to collaborate technical information with the team
- not afraid of making mistakes
- synergy with team members
- simple and clean code
- small commits and commit history
- great test scenarios

## Technical challenge

Ask PayWith developers for instructions and the `challenge link` during the Pair Programming Interview.
