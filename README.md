# Ruby Pair Programming Interview

Thanks for taking the time to complete this exercise. We're excited that you're considering joining our amazing team.

## Application

The goal of the application in this repository is to provide you a very basic Rails API so you don't need to run `rails new new_app` and scaffolding a new backend app. We didn't include a test suite, because the idea is to let developers choose which tools they prefer to use.

## Goals

We don't want to see a complete solution for this challenge.

This is an opportunity for you to shine and show us how quality driven you are. Things we look out for in your solution:

- great communication
- working solution that meets all of the requirements
- your ability to collaborate technical information with the team
- not afraid of making mistakes
- sinergy with team members
- simple and clean code
- small commits and commit history
- great test scenarios

## Next steps

Ask PayWith developers for instructions and the `challenge link` during the Pair Programming Interview.
